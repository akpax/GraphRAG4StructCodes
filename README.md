# GraphRAG4StructCodes


## Project Outcomes:
* Enhanced ChatGPT using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy in answering questions about structural building codes.
* Scraped and parsed structural building code data into individual sections and identified relationships between sections using Beautiful Soup.
* Pushed sections of text into a Neo4j graph database and added relationships between referenced sections.
* Utilized LangChain to query relevant nodes and relationships from Neo4j to add context to ChatGPT queries.
